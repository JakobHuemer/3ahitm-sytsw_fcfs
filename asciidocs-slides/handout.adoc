= First Come First Served (FCFS)

== What is FCFS?

- *Definition*: Processes execute in FIFO order (non-preemptive).
- Runs each job *to completion*.
- Known for **long average waiting times** due to no burst-time sorting.

== Key Characteristics

- **Simple & Fair**: No prioritization; easy to implement.
- **Convoy Effect**: Long processes delay shorter ones.
- *No preemption* → Suitable for batch systems.

== Example Scenarios

|===
|Process Order |P1 |P2 |P3 |Avg Waiting Time

|Original (24, 3, 3 ms)
|0ms
|24ms
|27ms
|*17ms*

|Optimized (3, 3, 24 ms)
|0ms
|3ms
|6ms
|*3ms*
|===

*Insight*: Order impacts efficiency. Shortest Job First (SJF) mitigates this.

== Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive
[.text-left]
- *Non-Preemptive (FCFS)*:
* ✔️ Low overhead | ❌ Convoy effect | Example: Batch systems
- *Preemptive*:
* ✔️ Responsive | ❌ High context-switching | Example: Round Robin

== Scheduling Metrics

- *Burst Time*: Actual CPU execution duration.
- *Waiting Time*: Total time in ready queue.
- *Turnaround Time*: Exit time − Arrival time.
- *Response Time*: First CPU allocation − Arrival time.

// Implementation Note: FIFO queue, no interruptions.
