= First Come, First Served (FCFS) Scheduling

Version 1.0 | 2024-02-12

== What is FCFS?
- *Definition*: Processes are executed in the order they arrive (*FIFO*).
- *Non-preemptive*: Once a process starts, it runs *to completion*.
- *Key Metric*: Can result in *long average waiting times*.

== Key Characteristics
✔ *Simple & Fair*: Easy to implement, no prioritization.
❌ *Convoy Effect*: Long processes delay shorter ones.
❌ *No Optimization*: Doesn’t consider burst time.

== Example: Waiting Times
*Scenario 1 (High Waiting Time):*
- P1: 0ms, P2: 24ms, P3: 27ms -> *Average: 17ms*

*Scenario 2 (Better Distribution):*
- P1: 0ms, P2: 3ms, P3: 6ms -> *Average: 3ms*

== Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling
[options="header"]
|===
| Preemptive | Non-Preemptive
| Processes can be interrupted | Runs to completion once started
| Higher overhead (context switches) | Lower overhead
| Better for time-sharing | May cause convoy effect
| Examples: Round Robin, SRTF | Examples: FCFS, Non-preemptive SJF
|===

== Basic FCFS Implementation (FIFO Queue in Java)
[source,java]
----
private final Queue<MyProcess> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
public void schedule(MyProcess myProcess) {
    queue.add(myProcess);
}
public void runCpu() {
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        var process = queue.poll();
        process.run();
    }
}
----

== Key Scheduling Metrics
- *Burst Time*: CPU execution time (End time - Start time).
- *Arrival Time*: When a process enters the queue.
- *Waiting Time*: Time spent in the ready queue.
- *Turnaround Time*: Completion time - Arrival time.
- *Response Time*: First CPU allocation - Arrival time.

== Summary
1. FCFS executes processes in arrival order (*FIFO*).
2. *Pros*: Simple, fair, and low overhead.
3. *Cons*: Can cause long waiting times due to *Convoy Effect*.
4. *Key Metrics*: Burst, Arrival, Waiting, Response, and Turnaround Time.
5. *Preemption vs. Non-Preemption*: Preemption helps avoid delays but adds overhead.
